## 面试英文问答

### Q1:What is your favorite course?

My favorite course is Computer Organization. It taught me how a computer works from the inside, such as CPU, memory, and instruction execution. It helped me build a strong foundation for later courses.

### Q2:Can you introduce your laptop?

My laptop has an AMD processor, an NVIDIA RTX 3060 graphics card, 16 GB of RAM, and a 1 TB hard drive. I mainly use it for coding, running experiments, and daily study.

### Q3:What programming languages are you most familiar with?

 I am most familiar with C++ and Python. I use C++ for system programming and algorithms, and Python for machine learning and data analysis.

### Q4:Can you introduce one project you did?

I implemented a simple compiler in C++. The project includes lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. It helped me understand how a compiler works and practice my programming skills.

### Q5:What operating system do you usually use?

I usually use Windows for daily tasks. For some project experiments, I also use Linux, such as Ubuntu.
